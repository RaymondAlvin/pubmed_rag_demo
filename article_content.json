Today two new categories (gepants and ditans) are marketed for acute \n      migraine treatment. That said, is there still a role for conventional therapy? \n      The aim of the present narrative review is to provide an expert overview \n      examining the possible role of the combination paracetamol/caffeine in treatment \n      of acute migraine pain. METHODS: To understand possible settings for more \n      appropriate use of paracetamol/caffeine (1000 mg/130 mg) in treatment of acute \n      migraine, a structured literature search was performed using the PubMed database \n      by a panel of experts from major Italian headache centers; articles not referring \n      to migraine pain were excluded from this review; review articles were \n      prioritized. RESULTS: Overall response, even to newer specific and selective \n      trigeminal targeted drugs (TTTs), is not over 60%; thus, there is still room for \n      conventional therapies in acute migraine treatment. The panel identified settings \n      in which the use of paracetamol/caffeine combination to treat acute migraine \n      attacks might offer benefit considering the consolidated use through years, \n      despite the lack of studies directly addressing the efficacy of \n      paracetamol/caffeine in the identified populations: subjects > 65 years of age; \n      presence of cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities; TTTs non-responders; pregnancy and \n      breastfeeding; subjects < 18 years of age; paracetamol/caffeine as add-on \n      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol is included in the World Health Organization \n      (WHO) essential drug list and has a high level of popularity among patients. \n      Caffeine enhances the analgesic effect of other drugs including paracetamol. In \n      early treatment of acute migraine pain, prescribing physicians might consider \n      using the paracetamol/caffeine combination among other options.\nCI  - (c) 2024.

For this, the PubChem database of the NIH (National Institutes \n      of Health) was used to obtain the SMILE canonical form of the bioactive \n      molecules, and the free software PASS Online (Prediction of Activity Spectra for \n      Substances) from the Way2Drug portal. Also, we conducted an in vitro experiment \n      using a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line (K562) to confirm some results \n      found in in silico investigation. These cells were exposed to different \n      concentrations of caffeine, (+)-catechin, and theobromine for 72 h. The results \n      found in this in silico study suggested that caffeine, (+)-catechin, and \n      theobromine showed excellent biological properties, such as antioxidant, \n      anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic, as well as protection against \n      cardiovascular, diabetes, neurological, allergic, respiratory, and other \n      therapeutic activities. These findings can be elucidated through the modulation \n      exerted by these bioactive molecules in many biochemical pathways involved in \n      organism homeostasis, such as free radical scavenger action, oxidoreductase \n      inhibitor, membrane permeability inhibitor, and lipid peroxidase inhibitor. In \n      addition, we have found here that caffeine, (+)-catechin, and theobromine have a \n      remarkable anti-inflammatory activity which plays an important role in the \n      therapeutic approach of COVID-19. Moreover, our in vitro findings confirmed the \n      in silico results regarding anticancer activity since these molecules reduce cell \n      proliferation at all tested concentrations. Therefore, since these molecules \n      exhibit important medicinal activities, further investigations should be \n      conducted to reveal new therapies to improve the treatments and prevention of \n      numerous disorders and, consequently, promote human health.\nCI  - (c) King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2024.

We evaluated age and sex \n      differences in a set of seventeen compounds, including eleven antibiotics, five \n      NSAIDs and caffeine, evaluated by HPLC-MS-TOF analysis in griffon vultures (Gyps \n      fulvus) from central Spain. Pharmaceutical cocktails (up to 10 compounds \n      simultaneously) were found in all individuals. Lincomycin was detected in all \n      individuals, and fluoroquinolones were found at high frequencies, while NSAIDs \n      were at low frequencies and concentrations, including flumixin meglumine, which \n      can be lethal to vultures. A higher total number of compounds and sum of \n      concentrations, as well as prevalence and concentration of several of the \n      pharmaceuticals tested was found in females than in males for both nestlings and \n      adults. This is the first study to present evidence of sex differences in the \n      pharmacokinetics of dietary drug contaminants in a vulture species. Chronic \n      exposure to \"medications\" in entire populations can potentially have sub-lethal \n      health effects that affect fitness differently according to age and sex, with \n      demographic implications for population viability. Specifically, if females have \n      higher mortality after fledging due to high pharmaceutical contamination, this \n      should be considered when modelling the population dynamic of this species for \n      conservation purposes.\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2024.

However, these \n      substances can lead to dependence and other undesired symptoms, and little \n      empirical data are available for relevant stakeholders, raising significant \n      concerns in health care. Therefore, this study aims to characterize \n      neurostimulant use among university students in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We \n      collected from 880 students' data using anonymous self-administration. The \n      questionnaire included consumption patterns of caffeine, nicotine, ecstasy, \n      methamphetamine, \"merla\" (coca base), methylphenidate, cocaine, crack, and \n      ketamine. Additionally, participants shared information on demographic and \n      socioeconomic factors. Use of at least one neurostimulant was reported by89.2% of \n      the participants. Among nonusers, the most frequently cited reason was \"previous \n      information about harmful effects of these drugs.\" Caffeine, followed by \n      nicotine, ecstasy, and methylphenidate were the most consumed substances, with \n      main reasons being \"improving academic performance\" and \"recreation.\" Women more \n      often consumed caffeine (72.7%), while other psychostimulants were more consumed \n      by men (42.2%) and individuals of other genders (0.5%). Students who consumed \n      other substances had higher family incomes than that of families of caffeine \n      users. In addition, 60.4% of caffeine users resided with family members, whereas \n      63.3% of users of other substances did not. Our findings can offer essential data \n      on the reasons and symptoms associated with the use of neurostimulants among \n      university students.

The aims were to determine adherence and whether demographic \n      characteristics were associated with adherence. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. \n      SETTING: Online survey of postpartum women resident in England during pregnancy. \n      PARTICIPANTS: Recently postpartum women resident in England during their \n      pregnancy (n=598; median age 33 (IQR 30-36) years) completed an online \n      questionnaire (April to November 2022). Questions included those on consumption \n      of 21 food/drink items that the NHS advises pregnant women to avoid/limit. The \n      study is part of the Pregnancy, the Environment And nutRition (PEAR) Study. \n      Summary statistics were used to determine proportions adhering to the guidance. \n      Adjusted logistic regression was used to model the associations of adherence with \n      demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Adherence was generally high (>90% for \n      eight of ten food/drink items to be avoided). However, among pre-pregnancy \n      consumers, several items were not completely avoided: e.g. 81% (128/158) for game \n      meat/gamebirds, 37% (176/478) for cured meats pre-pregnancy, and 17% (81/467) for \n      soft cheeses. Greater educational attainment (e.g. caffeinated soft drinks OR \n      2.25 (95% CI 1.28, 3.94)), greater maternal age (e.g. oily fish 1.64 (1.05, \n      2.56)) and lower parity were the most usual characteristics associated with \n      adherence. CONCLUSION: Evidence of concerning levels of non-adherence for some \n      food/drink items suggest a case for more education on some of the guidance, \n      particularly for women with lower educational attainment, greater parity and \n      greater maternal age.

Thus, we evaluated the impact of caffeine, a potent \n      antioxidant, on cellular and tissue disorders in mice with chronic SHT. METHODS: \n      In this experimental study, 56 adult male NMRI mice were allocated into seven \n      equal groups. Apart from the non-treated control group, all were exposed to heat \n      stress. Two groups, termed \"preventive\" and \"curative,\" were orally administered \n      caffeine. The preventive mice began receiving caffeine immediately prior to heat \n      exposure, while for the curative group, a caffeine regimen was initiated 15 \n      consecutive days following cessation of heat exposure. Each treated group was \n      subdivided based on pairing with a positive control (Pre/curative [Cur]+PC) or a \n      vehicle (Pre/Cur+vehicle). Upon conclusion of the study, we assessed sperm \n      characteristics, testosterone levels, stereological parameters, apoptosis, \n      antioxidant and oxidant levels, and molecular markers. RESULTS: Sperm parameters, \n      testosterone levels, stereological parameters, biochemical factors (excluding \n      malondialdehyde [MDA]), and c-kit gene expression were significantly elevated in \n      the preventive and curative groups, especially the former, relative to the other \n      groups. Conversely, expression levels of the heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) and \n      nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappabeta) genes, MDA levels, and apoptotic cell density \n      were markedly lower in both caffeine-treated groups relative to the other groups, \n      with more pronounced differences observed in the preventive group. CONCLUSION: \n      Overall, caffeine attenuated cellular and molecular abnormalities induced by heat \n      stress in the testis, particularly in the mice treated under the preventive \n      condition.\nFAU - Raoofi, Amir\nAU  - Raoofi A\nAD  - Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, \n      Sabzevar, Iran.\nFAU - Gholami, Omid\nAU  - Gholami O\nAD  - Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, \n      Sabzevar, Iran.\nFAU - Mokhtari, Hossein\nAU  - Mokhtari H\nAD  - Department of Paramedicine, Amol School of Paramedical Sciences, Mazandaran \n      University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.\nFAU - Bagheri, Fatemeh\nAU  - Bagheri F\nAD  - Student Research Committee, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, Sabzevar, \n      Iran.\nFAU - Rustamzadeh, Auob\nAU  - Rustamzadeh A\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, \n      Tehran, Iran.\nFAU - Nasiry, Davood\nAU  - Nasiry D\nAD  - Department of Paramedicine, Amol School of Paramedical Sciences, Mazandaran \n      University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.\nFAU - Ghaemi, Alireza\nAU  - Ghaemi A\nAD  - Department of Basic Sciences and Nutrition, Health Sciences Research Center, \n      Faculty of Public Health, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.\nLA  - eng\nGR  - 400025/Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences/\nPT  - Journal Article\nDEP - 20240229\nPL  - Korea (South)\nTA  - Clin Exp Reprod Med\nJT  - Clinical and experimental reproductive medicine\nJID - 101563916\nPMC - PMC10914498\nOTO - NOTNLM\nOT  - Apoptosis\nOT  - Caffeine\nOT  - Chronic scrotal hyperthermia\nOT  - Inflammation\nOT  - Oxidative stress\nCOIS- Conflict of interest No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article \n      was reported.\nEDAT- 2024/03/04 00:43\nMHDA- 2024/03/04 00:44\nCRDT- 2024/03/03 21:27\nPHST- 2023/05/13 00:00 [received]\nPHST- 2023/09/19 00:00 [accepted]\nPHST- 2024/03/04 00:44 [medline]\nPHST- 2024/03/04 00:43 [pubmed]\nPHST- 2024/03/03 21:27 [entrez]\nAID - cerm.2023.06142 [pii]\nAID - cerm-2023-06142 [pii]\nAID - 10.5653/cerm.2023.06142 [doi]\nPST - ppublish\nSO  - Clin Exp Reprod Med. 2024 Mar;51(1):28-41. doi: 10.5653/cerm.2023.06142.

The nutrition strategies used by \n      powerlifters around training sessions have not, to our knowledge, been previously \n      investigated. This study explored the self-reported periworkout (before, during, \n      and after) nutrition practices of competitive powerlifters, including what, why, \n      and information source that informed practice, with comparison to current sport \n      nutrition guidelines. METHODS: Actively competing male (n = 240) and female (n = \n      65) powerlifters completed a cross-sectional online survey of self-reported \n      periworkout nutrition practices in the pre-, intra-, and postexercise periods, \n      fasted training, and supplementation. Data are presented as the number (n) and \n      percentage (%) of all powerlifters practicing a given strategy followed by a % of \n      responses reporting various practices or beliefs within this strategy. \n      Categorical subgroups (sex, age, and weight class; and competitive caliber) were \n      analyzed with a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and denoted where \n      significant (P </= 0.05). RESULTS: Most powerlifters reported paying specific \n      attention to nutrition practices in the pre-exercise period (n = 261; 85.6%) by \n      ingesting more carbohydrate (CHO) rich foods (n = 234; 89.6%) for the purpose of \n      assisting in training performance (n = 222; 85.1%). Most powerlifters reported \n      intraexercise nutrition strategies (n = 211; 69.2%), of which most included \n      ingesting more CHO rich foods (n = 159; 74.5%) for the purpose of feeling less \n      hungry and/or boosting energy levels during training (n = 129; 61.1%). Most \n      powerlifters reported paying attention to postexercise nutrition (n = 244; 80%), \n      by ingesting more protein rich foods (n = 182; 74.6%) for the purpose of \n      recovering better for the whole day (n = 152; 62.3%) and enhancing the benefits \n      of training (n = 149; 61.1%). Most powerlifters did not complete training \n      sessions in the fasted state (n = 262; 85.9%). Most powerlifters reported paying \n      attention to supplementation before training (n = 237; 77.7%), of which \n      preworkout formulas (n = 137; 57.8%), energy drinks (n = 101; 42.6%), creatine (n \n      = 88; 37.1%), and caffeine pills (n = 70; 29.5%) were most reported. \n      Supplementation was used to assist in training performance (n = 197; 83.1%) and \n      increase wakefulness/alertness (n = 183; 77.2%). Males reported more often than \n      females that they informed multiple elements of their nutrition practices with \n      the information they read or watched somewhere (P = 0.002-0.012). CONCLUSION: The \n      periworkout nutrition practices used by competitive powerlifters followed current \n      sport nutrition guidelines, by using CHO sources to fuel for training and \n      ensuring the provision of protein postexercise. Competitive powerlifters may wish \n      to exert caution with supplementation, as there is a risk of harm or inadvertent \n      doping.\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

We aimed to investigate the association between caffeine, \n      coffee and cola drink intake in early pregnancy and the risk of gestational \n      diabetes (GDM). METHODS: Kuopio Birth Cohort (KuBiCo) is a prospective cohort \n      study including pregnant women who were followed at the prenatal clinics in \n      outpatient healthcare centers and gave birth in Kuopio University Hospital, \n      Finland (n=2214). Maternal diet during the first trimester of pregnancy was \n      assessed using a 160-item food frequency questionnaire. GDM was diagnosed by oral \n      glucose tolerance test according to the Finnish national guidelines mainly \n      between 24 and 28 gestational weeks. RESULTS: Women with moderate coffee intake \n      in the first trimester were less likely diagnosed with GDM than women without \n      coffee intake in an age-adjusted model (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-0.99; p = 0.03), but \n      the association was attenuated in multi-adjusted models (p = 0.11). No \n      association was found between caffeine intake and GDM. One third (32.4%) of \n      pregnant women consumed caffeine over the recommendation (> 200\u202fmg/d). Women who \n      consumed cola drinks more than the median (33.3\u202fmL/d) had an increased risk of \n      GDM (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.02-1.63, p = 0.037) in multi-adjusted model compared to \n      those who consumed less. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine intake during the first trimester \n      of pregnancy was not associated with the risk of GDM but a minor non-significant \n      decrease was seen with moderate coffee intake. Although the average consumption \n      of cola drinks was low in the KuBiCo cohort, higher consumption was associated \n      with an increased risk of GDM. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safe \n      amount of coffee during pregnancy, since the recommended caffeine intake was \n      exceeded in almost half of the coffee drinkers.\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2024 The Authors.

Evidence supports improved hearing recovery with early steroid \n      treatment, via oral, intravenous, intratympanic or a combination of routes. The \n      STARFISH trial aims to identify the most clinically and cost-effective route of \n      administration of steroids as first-line treatment for ISSNHL. STARFISH is a \n      pragmatic, multicentre, assessor-blinded, three-arm intervention, superiority \n      randomised controlled trial (1:1:1) with an internal pilot (ISRCTN10535105, IRAS \n      1004878). 525 participants with ISSNHL will be recruited from approximately 75 UK \n      Ear, Nose and Throat units. STARFISH will recruit adults with sensorineural \n      hearing loss averaging 30dBHL or greater across three contiguous frequencies \n      (confirmed via pure tone audiogram), with onset over a </=3-day period, within four \n      weeks of randomisation. Participants will be randomised to 1) oral prednisolone \n      1mg/Kg/day up to 60mg/day for 7 days; 2) intratympanic dexamethasone: three \n      intratympanic injections 3.3mg/ml or 3.8mg/ml spaced 7+/-2 days apart; or 3) \n      combined oral and intratympanic steroids. The primary outcome will be absolute \n      improvement in pure tone audiogram average at 12-weeks following randomisation \n      (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0kHz). Secondary outcomes at 6 and 12 weeks will include: \n      Speech, Spatial and Qualities of hearing scale, high frequency pure tone average \n      thresholds (4.0, 6.0 and 8.0kHz), Arthur Boothroyd speech test, Vestibular \n      Rehabilitation Benefit Questionnaire, Tinnitus Functional Index, adverse events \n      and optional weekly online speech and pure tone hearing tests. A health economic \n      assessment will be performed, and presented in terms of incremental cost \n      effectiveness ratios, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year. Primary analyses \n      will be by intention-to-treat. Oral prednisolone will be the reference. For the \n      primary outcome, the difference between group means and 97.5% confidence \n      intervals at each time-point will be estimated via a repeated measures \n      mixed-effects linear regression model.\nCI  - Copyright: (c) 2024 Smith et al.
